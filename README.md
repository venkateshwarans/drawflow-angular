# Angular Drawflow Example

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.2.

The main purpose for this project is to create a working angular demo that implements this cool feature [Drawflow](https://github.com/jerosoler/Drawflow) created by [Jero Soler](https://github.com/jerosoler), watch the [LIVE DEMO](https://jerosoler.github.io/Drawflow/) for more information.
You can also change drawflow theme using [THEME EDIT GENERATOR](https://jerosoler.github.io/drawflow-theme-generator/).

I've created a simple list of customizable elements, in which you can specify the number of inputs and outputs for each element.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
